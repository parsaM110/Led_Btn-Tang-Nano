based on video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5hlv3XTcO0 by `xesscorp` ( my board is tang-nano  which is simillar to tang-nano-1k)
you pick it when you are creating project :

because the impl is on SRAM ,  after the power got cut off it backs to default mode

no need for any type of programmer ( just standard tyep c connector ) 
> Yes, and Tang Nano boards ship with JTAG + USB debugger on board. It's quite nice.

at official documentaion of tang nano there was a link for downloading the software programmer :
https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-1K/Nano-1k.html

which lead to these :

### ðŸ“Œ there is also other ways to program tang-nano-1k fpga board
* using gowin (http://www.gowinsemi.com.cn/faq.aspx)
* one way is to use openfpgalaoder (open-source) : which seems to support all kind of tang-nano-boards (my board : https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano/Nano.html)
  * https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader (there is a list of compatibility boards which tang-nano is included)
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh9VfCvTWck (video is for tang-nano-4k)
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/GowinFPGA/comments/106si63/asking_for_help_tang_nano_9k_programmer_linux/
* there seems to be another way using oss-cad-suite-build (which is from YosisHQ) which is used by platform.io and lushaylabs but seems it is for tang-nano-9k only
